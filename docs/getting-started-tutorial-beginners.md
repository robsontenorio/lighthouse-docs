This is a very basic intro about GraphQL world with Lighthouse. Keep in mind there is a lot to learn about it. 

## What is GraphQL ?

GraphQL is just a specification. Defined by self as a "Query Language for APIs". It provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

<br />

GraphQL has been released only as a [*specification*](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/). This means that GraphQL is in fact not more than a long document that describes in detail the behaviour of a GraphQL server. 

So, GraphQL has its own type system thatâ€™s used to define the schema of an API. The syntax for writing schemas is called Schema Definition Language ([SDL](https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-sdl-schema-definition-language-6755bcb9ce51/)).


Here is an example how we can use the SDL to define a simple type called `Person` and its relationships between another type `Post`. This is a pure GraphQL schema definition, regardless of frameworks.

```graphql
type Person {
  name: String!
  age: Int!
  posts: [Post]
}

type Post {
  title: String!
  author: Person!
}
```

Note that we just created a one-to-many-relationship between `Person` and `Post`, since the `posts` field on `Person` is actually an array of `Post`. On the another hand, we also defined the inverse relationship from `Post` to `Person` through `author` field.

## What is Lighthouse?

Lighthouse is A GraphQL Server for Laravel. It is a PHP package that allows you to serve a GraphQL endpoint from your Laravel application. Lighthouse greatly reduces the boilerplate required to create a schema (SDL). It integrates well with any Laravel project and is highly customizable, giving you full control over your data. 

The whole process can be described in 3 steps:

1. Write a schema according to GraphQL specification
1. Decorate it with some built-in Lighthouse server directives
1. Optionally, write some custom `resolvers`

<br />
... and you are done!

<br />


## Let's do it!

In this tutorial we will create a GraphQL API for a simple Blog from scratch with:

- Laravel 5.7
- Lighthouse 2.x
- Laravel GraphQL Playground
- Mysql 

<br />

> You can download the source code for this tutorial at https://github.com/nuwave/lighthouse-tutorial

<br />

## Basic setup

Create a fresh new laravel project.

```bash
laravel new lighthouse-tutorial
```

In this tutorial we will use [Laravel Graphql Playground](https://github.com/mll-lab/laravel-graphql-playground) as IDE for GraphQL queries. It's like Postman for GraphQL, but with super powers. Of course, we will use Lighthouse as the GraphQL Server.

```bash
# lighthouse 
composer require nuwave/lighthouse 

# laravel graphql playground
composer require mll-lab/laravel-graphql-playground
```

Then publish vendor config files
```bash
# lighthouse
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Nuwave\Lighthouse\Providers\LighthouseServiceProvider"

# playground
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="MLL\GraphQLPlayground\GraphQLPlaygroundServiceProvider"
```

> Note that `routes/schema.graphql` was published with a sample schema. Don't worry about it. We will change it in a while. But before, we make sure everything is working fine with the default instalment in the following next steps.

<br />

You can change Lighthouse and Laravel Playground default configs as needed. In this case, change default namespaces for Models in  `config/lighthouse.php` , in order to keep it same as Laravel default namespaces.

```php
'namespaces' => [
        'models' => 'App', 
        ...
],
```

Make sure to create a empty `blog_db` database and set up connection variables in  `.env` file 

```bash
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=blog_db
DB_USERNAME=username
DB_PASSWORD=password
```


Run migrations, seed database with some fake users and start the server.

```php
# create tables (DDL)
php artisan migrate

# open tinker shell
php artisan tinker

# run this command inside tinker and exit
factory('App\User', 10)->create();

# start the server
php artisan serve

```

To make sure everything is working fine, access Laravel GraphQL Playground on http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql-playground and try some Queries:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: 1) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

Now, let's move on and create a GraphQL API for our Blog.

<br />

## The Models

One user can publish many posts, and each post has many comments from anonymous users.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/docs/assets/tutorial/model.png">  
  <p><small>Diagram</small></p>
</div>

This first part is pure Laravel, we will add GraphQL part afterwards. Remember to run migration command after  creating models and migrations:

```php
php artisan migrate
```

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use Notifiable;

    protected $fillable = [
        'name', 'email', 'password',
    ];

    protected $hidden = [
        'password', 'remember_token',
    ];

    public function posts()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Post::class);
    }
}
```

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    public function user()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
    }

    public function comments()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Comment::class);
    }
}
```

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Comment extends Model
{
    public function post()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Post::class);
    }
}
```

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;

class CreatePostsTable extends Migration
{
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->increments('id');
            $table->unsignedInteger('user_id');
            $table->string('title');
            $table->string('content');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }

    public function down()
    {
        Schema::dropIfExists('posts');
    }
}
```

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;

class CreateCommentsTable extends Migration
{
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('comments', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->increments('id');
            $table->unsignedInteger('post_id');
            $table->string('reply');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }

    public function down()
    {
        Schema::dropIfExists('comments');
    }
}
```

## The Magic

Let's edit `routes/schema.graphql` and define our blog schema, based on the Eloquent Models we created. This is pure GraphQL schema definition (SDL), but with some Lighthouse sorcery through directives. 


```graphql
type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    email: String!
    created_at: DateTime!
    updated_at: DateTime!
    posts: [Post] @hasMany
}

type Post {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
    content: String!
    user: User! @belongsTo
    comments: [Comment] @hasMany
}

type Comment{
    id: ID!
    reply: String!
    post: Post! @belongsTo
}

type Query{
    posts: [Post] @all
    post (id: Int! @eq): Post @find
}

```


In this example:


- Note that `type` name is the same as a Eloquent Model
- Lighthouse directives add some behavior in your schema
  - `@hasMany` / `@belongsTo` express eloquent relationships 
  - `@all` fetch all eloquent models and return the collection
  - `@find` find a model based on the arguments provided
  - `@eq` places an equal operator on a eloquent query.  

<br/> 
  > There are tons of other directives in Ligthouse, you can read more about them [here](https://lighthouse-php.netlify.com/docs/directives).

<br />

## It is working!

Insert some fake data into database, point to 
http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql-playground and try this query

```graphql
query{
  posts{
    id
    title
    user{
      id
      name
    }
    comments{
      id
      reply
    }
  }
}

```
